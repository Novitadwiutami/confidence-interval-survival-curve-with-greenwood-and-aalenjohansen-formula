# confidence-interval-survival-curve-with-greenwood-and-aalenjohansen-formula
This study aims to analyze the confidence intervals of risk factor survival curve that affect the survival times of cervical cancer patients at Surabaya Oncologi Huspital using the Greenwood Formula and Aalen-Johansen Formula. The result of the Kaplan Meier Curve show that the variables that have differences in survival curves are marital status, stage of cancer, and surgical treatment. The result of the confidence interval analysis of survival curves indicate that the confidence interval calculated using Aalen-Johansen Formula has shorter interval width than confidence interval calculated using Greenwood Forumla for all research variables.
